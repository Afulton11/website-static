# This repository all the styling and html used for my website
I started with the initial repository ![here](https://github.com/programmiri/brunch-setup-bootstrap4).

# Installation

   1. Clone it.
   
   2. Run `yarn install` to install needed dependencies
   
   3. Run `yarn start` to start the local server and see what the static html looks like.
